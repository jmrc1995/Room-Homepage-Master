# Frontend Mentor - Room Homepage 2022 (Intermediate)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

``` View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
``` See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
``` Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
``` Want some support on the challenge? Join our Slack community and ask questions in the #help channel.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Framer Motion
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
- Created hooks to share && render components, logic, styling, etc. through the use of media queries.
- Used Stlyed Components to create the carousel content and images.
- Implemented Sass, to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more within my CSS

### Continued development

- I would like to keep focusing on implementing styled components within my react projects, and exploring other react hooks.
